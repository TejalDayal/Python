1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included). 

2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit. 
[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ] 
Expected Output : 
60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
45°F is 7 in Celsius 

3. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.
Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 
Expected Output : 
Number of even numbers : 5
Number of odd numbers : 4

4. Write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number.

5. Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer). The function accepts the number as an argument

6. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.

7. Take a list, say for example this one:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than N(User input number).
  Extras:  
   Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than N(User input number) from this list in it and print out this new list.

8. Python Program to Print the Fibonacci sequence
	- Ask user input number N > 0
        - Pass N in python function which prints Fibonacci sequence
	- Print Fibonacci sequence till that number

9. Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not.

10. Write a Python program to remove and print every third number from a list of numbers until the list becomes empty.





1. Write a python program to print the square of all numbers from 0 to 10

2. Write a python program to find the sum of all even numbers from 0 to 10
